    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Due to the (often unpoliced) use of raw materials such as wood, diamond, gold and precious metals and also due to agriculture and livestock farming, <strong>two thirds of the Congo Basin Forest could be lost by 2040 if nothing is done.</strong></li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong> The end of the oil era in Gabon</strong> and the lack of economic diversity place a heavy and unprecedented burden on Gabon’s forest resources. </li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The <strong>forest operators within the region almost systematically ignore their legal obligations</strong> to pay a pro-rated tax in proportion to the volume of wood taken, payable to the neighbouring village communities in accordance with <strong>Article 251 of Act No. 16/2001 on the Forest Code</strong> in Republic of Gabon (« <strong>terms of contract</strong> » rarely enforced or respected ).</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The <strong>increasing desertification of community forests, the absence of supervision and the lack of means to promote awareness of</strong> the proper management of these forests, the impoverishment and ageing of the villagers as well as corruption expose the entire Gabonese fauna and flora to illegal exploitation which is both highly unsustainable and more and more irrecoverably destructive.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Poaching and the poor management of the forest eco system </strong> are pushing the animals, in particular the elephants, slaughtered for their ivory and no longer able to get sufficient nourishment from the forest, to go and look for food in the village plantations, creating a <strong>conflict between humans and wildlife</strong> that is very difficult to resolve.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>The villagers lack the </strong>technical and financial means as well the knowledge and tools that would allow them to make full economical use of their natural and cultural heritage<strong>, to be able to engage in sustainable permaculture agro-forestry projects </strong>capable of providing them with food, medicinal and cosmetic self-sufficiency.</li>
