    <strong> Gabon is situated at the very heart of Africa</strong>, on the Atlantic coast with over 800km of coastline. It straddles the equator as does its neighbour The Republic of the Congo and The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). In the northwest of the country, along the coastline and embedded within the Gabonese territory, is Equatorial Guinea. The northern border also separates Gabon from Cameroon. The rest of the country runs alongside the Congo, to the east and south. Apart from the Atlantic Ocean, which is to the west, all the other Gabonese borders are artificial and are the result of past agreements:
    In 1886, by the decree of governor Savorgnan of Brazza who established the borders between Gabon and The Congo to the south.
    In 1900, between France and Spain who established the northwest border.
    In 1919, between France and Germany who established the northern border.

    The land mass of Gabon has a compact shape (600 km from east to west) and has a surface area of 267,667 km². It’s the smallest state in central Africa after Ruanda, Burundi and Equatorial Guinea.
    <strong>It is a forest country</strong> (with approximately 85% of its land mass covered by forest) where the fauna and flora are still well preserved and protected inside <strong>thirteen national parks</strong> including The National Park of La Lopé, which is which is registered on the UNESCO world heritage.

    Gabon has a typically equatorial climate, that is to say warm and humid, characterised by stable and elevated temperatures all year round (the average temperature is 26°), significant atmospheric humidity due to plenty of rain, which falls all year round (the average rainfall is 2m).

    Thanks to its small population, significant forest resources and an abundance of petrol, Gabon is one of the most prosperous countries in Africa with one of the highest levels of human development on the continent. Gabon shows evidence of the oldest remains of multicellular life known to date (2017). They go back to 2.1 million years and were discovered in the region of Franceville in 2008.

    With regards to humans, there is evidence of a prehistoric population going as far back as 400,000 years ago and continuing up to the iron age. The six groups, including the Pigmies, which emerged from this population are the first known inhabitants of what is currently known as Gabon. These hunter gatherers settled there approximately five thousand years before the current era, followed by a wave of Bantu, which comprises forty-five different ethnicities. The Bantu left the sahelian zone, which was drying up, five thousand years ago and continued their expansion towards the south and east approximately 1000 or 2000 years before the current era.
