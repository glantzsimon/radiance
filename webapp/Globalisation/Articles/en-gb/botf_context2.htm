    When the Bantu encountered the Pigmies, they discovered that this indigenous population of Africa practises the worship of animal spirits and is made up of “mediators of the sacred”, which change according to the rites.
    Throughout the initiation, specific knowledge about the mastery of the forest and the weather elements (rain, lightening…) is acquired, giving rise to a shamanic conception of the workings of the world where the initiated knows how to get in contact with the spirits of nature in order to act upon any given symptoms.
    This initiation, when undergone as a rite of passage into adulthood and with a view to encouraging social integration, consists primarily of the consumption of their most sacred plant: Iboga.

<p>
    The use of the Iboga root has been known to the Pigmies since time immemorial. The archaeologist Richard Oslisly recently confirmed having found traces of it in charcoal (athracology) that was over two thousand years old, found in a cave in La Lopé, in southern Gabon.
    However, it would appear that the Pigmies only shared their knowledge of the “sacred wood” with the closest groups of Bantu during the middle of the 19th century. The first of these would have been the <span class="italic">Apinji</span> (literally <span class="italic">the forest</span>) and more specifically the <span class="italic">Apinji Mokodo</span> clan. Myth has it that the Apinji sought to get in contact with the realm of the dead.
</p>
<p>
    In order to do so, they would have consumed significant quantities of wood and would have consequently created the first ritualistic practices of the <span class="italic">Bwiti</span> religion, in order to protect themselves from the greater risks involved.
</p>
<p>
    The etymological root of the word <span class="italic">Bwiti</span>, according to M. Okaba, a linguist from the Chaillu Mountains, is a distortion of the Tsogho word <span class="italic">bo-hete</span>: “emancipation”, “liberation of a fluid” - (<span class="italic">Buetara</span>: “to draw” and <span class="italic">buera</span>: “to reach, to achieve…”).
</p>
<p>
    Bwiti, therefore, literally means that which enables man to find his freedom.
</p>

<p>
    Thus, Bwiti is a philosophy of liberation; it allows man to transcend matter, to become a <span class="italic">banzi</span>, which in the Tsogho language literally means “he who has hatched; who has come out of his shell”. And this philosophy is based on <span class="italic">eboghe</span>, “that which heals” (Iboga), <span class="italic">maganga</span> “that which allows a being to renew itself”, and <span class="italic">kangara</span>, “to heat up, regenerate” (the knowledge of plants).
