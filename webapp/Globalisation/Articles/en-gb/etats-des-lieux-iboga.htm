    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Despite the public declaration of the late president of the Gabonese republic, El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, made in the Council of Ministers on the 6th July 2000 which classified Iboga as a <span class="italic bold">"national cultural heritage”</span>  and <span class="italic bold">”strategic reserve”</span><span class="italic"> (“to be protected from illegal exploitation”)</span>, <strong>no legal texts</strong> have been amended to this effect thus leaving the door wide open to the trafficking and biopiracy taking place.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Iboga is an <strong>endemic plant of the equatorial forests of Central Africa</strong>, growing <strong> most abundantly in Gabon</strong>, although, to this day, it remains <strong>very difficult to cultivate</strong> outside of this region due to difficulties with the supply of viable seeds and also the lack of knowledge regarding the natural conditions necessary for its growth whilst preserving the botanical and chemical characteristics of each variety.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Due to <strong>global over-consumption</strong> of Iboga, the <strong>poaching</strong> of animals that naturally plant it, <strong>deforestation</strong>, <strong>climate change</strong> and the <strong>abandonment of the traditional village way of life </strong>, Iboga is becoming increasingly rare in Gabon and <strong>could well disappear from the Gabonese public domain by 2022</strong> if no sustainable conservation/plantation projects are put in place.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The traditionalist communities, in particular those which live in urban areas (more than 80% of the Gabonese population live in towns), find it more and more difficult to get hold of <strong>good quality and fairly priced Iboga</strong>. This causes <strong>serious public health problems</strong> (an upsurge in the sale of Iboga mixed with all sorts of inedible fillers, an increase in the number of <strong>fatal accidents</strong> due to the consumption of “fake Iboga”) and also problems <strong> preserving the Bwiti tradition</strong> as a whole (growing shortage of Iboga = <strong>increase in the consumption of alcohol</strong> and other psychoactive substances).</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The natural reserves of Iboga in Gabon are mainly sold for export, all around the world, by <strong>complex informal networks</strong>, sometimes in conjunction with criminal organisations (cross-border poaching), <strong>without a fair sharing of the profits </strong> from this <strong>very lucrative business</strong> or <strong>quality control, or traceability</strong>.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Several international laboratories wish to capitalise on Iboga </strong> (mainly of Gabonese origin) and its chemical constituents and are looking for ways to synthesize the extracted ibogaine, <strong>actively filing for patents</strong> for its clinical use, with complete disregard for the principles upheld by the <strong> Nagoya Protocol</strong> of which Gabon is the first signatory in the world.</li>
    <li class="scrollFadeUp"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>International scientists and therapists don’t really incorporate the thousands of years of knowledge accumulated by the Gabonese traditional communities about the use of Iboga nor does Gabon contribute to the discoveries made by international research regarding the field of therapeutic prospects and clinical applications.
