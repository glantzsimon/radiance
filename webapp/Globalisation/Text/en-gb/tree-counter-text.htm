    The Iboga trees planted directly as a result of your donations in the heart of the community forests supported by BOTF are listed separately from those planted by the village communities who have taken the initiative to invest in the Iboga plantations as a result of our awareness campaigns and without our financial support, but who wish to participate in time in the agricultural cooperative programme labelled "equitable & sustainable", which is just as committed to the Gabonese national market as it is to exportation (under the control of the laws in place in the requesting countries).
